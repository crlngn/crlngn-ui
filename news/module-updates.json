You can now customize the color accents for Foundry UI, and if you are feeling adventurous, apply the secondary color to the backgrounds. Use wisely. </li><li>For the moment, the backgrounds only work for dark mode.</li></ul>\n<p>Join the discussion on <a href='https://discord.gg/P5ygvHXE3R'>Discord</a> or visit the <a href='https://github.com/crlngn/crlngn-ui/releases'>Github repository</a>.</p>",
